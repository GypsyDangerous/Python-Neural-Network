# simple-deep-neural-network
a simple deep neural network i made in python

## The Network
the network is a multiplayer deep neural with a variable number of input nodes, hidden layers, hidden nodes in those layers, output nodes, and training epochs.  
the network is object oriented, so you can bring it in to your program by importing the file and creating a variable for a neural network. The network takes in 5 variable for the constructor function. the number of inputs, layers, hiddens, outputs, and epochs in that order.  
training the network involves creating a for loop over the networks epochs.
